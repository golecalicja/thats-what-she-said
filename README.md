## Introduction
As a fan of the popular TV show The Office, I conducted an analysis of the show's script using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. In particular, I used a tool called TF-IDF to identify important words in the script and uncover unique vocabulary for each character.

## TF-IDF
TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency and is a tool used to identify important words in a given text. It essentially calculates the frequency of a word in a document and compares it to the frequency of that word across all documents, allowing us to determine the unique words used by each character in the show.

## Word Cloud Visualization
To visualize the results of the analysis, I used word clouds for each character. The word clouds display the most important words for each character, and the size of the words reflects their importance in the script. 

## Results
Here are some word clouds showing the most unique words for each character:
